    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <p>
      Im a retired AirForce member. When I joined I was an avionics maintainer
      on KC-135 airframe. I swapped over to IT after 5 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started off as a programmer on Jovial working on AWACS airframe, moved
      over to testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then worked as a product owner and a project manager. With all my
      experiences within the military I enjoyed programming the most
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently working to getting back into the programming field</p>
